# How to add your program

First create a folder with a name simlar to your program without spaces in the "ProgramFiles" directory.

Then add your js file in it and the resources.
Make sure that all the file adresses in your js file are absolute like this: `https://minimos11.github.io/DesktopPrograms/ProgramFiles/Theprogramsfoldername/thefile.somthing`.

Then add your programs js file relative in the "index.js" file.
And also add your programs details to the programinfo list.
Here is template: `['function name', 'common name', 'icon'],`
Replace the placeholders with the following details:
The programs function name, its call/common name (like taskmgr becomes Task Manager), and icon is optional.

Please also add yourself to the credits.html.

Then it should be done and you can create a pull request.
