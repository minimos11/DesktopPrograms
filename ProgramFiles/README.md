# How to add your program

First create a folder with a name simlar to your program without spaces in the "ProgramFiles" directory.

Then add your js file in it and the resources.
Make sure that all the file adresses in your js file are absolute like this: `https://minimos11.github.io/DesktopPrograms/ProgramFiles/Theprogramsfoldername/thefile.somthing`.

Then add your programs js file relative in the "index.js" file.

Then it should be done and you can create a pull request.
